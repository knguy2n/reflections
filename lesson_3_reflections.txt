When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository would allow others to see and interact with the lastest version of your code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that you have control on what changes can be committed and allow others to suggest code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of other's repositories on GitHub
Cloning is making a copy of a repository on your local or from GitHub to local
Branches are a way to experiment on code while protecting your production code

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Because it allows you to have the lastest version of the code while allowing you to still experiment on your own branch

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without Git or GitHub you'd need to meet in person and compare code manually. Each person would have their own copy of the code but merging changes would be very difficult. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

You would make changes in a seperate branch when you need another person to look at the code and approve it. It would allow people to see the changes and approve them. Directly makes more sense if it's code thats not shared!
