When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository would allow others to see and interact with the lastest version of your code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that you have control on what changes can be committed and allow others to suggest code.
