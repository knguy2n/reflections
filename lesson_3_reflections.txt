When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository would allow others to see and interact with the lastest version of your code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that you have control on what changes can be committed and allow others to suggest code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of other's repositories on GitHub
Cloning is making a copy of a repository on your local or from GitHub to local
Branches are a way to experiment on code while protecting your production code
